Google Mail Parser reads email from gmail in a folder called "emails".

To get some emails to parse, do the following:

* Open up gmail
* go to a message
* click the little arrow (if you hover over it, it'll say "More")
* Click show original
* Copy/Paste that into a text file in the gmp/emails folder
